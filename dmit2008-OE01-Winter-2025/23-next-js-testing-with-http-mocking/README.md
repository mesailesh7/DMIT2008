# Next.js React Testing with Fetch Calls.

# Why?

Most of our applications will use fetch, and we only want to test code that we write. This means that we don't test any external packages that we import or any rest api calls we may make.

# Steps
1. Let's install Jest (like the last example) so that we can test our application [docs here](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing#jest-and-react-testing-library).
- install the required packages
```
npm install --save-dev jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```
- at the base of your project create a file named `jest.config.js` and add the following contents to it.
```js
// jest.config.js
const nextJest = require('next/jest')

const createJestConfig = nextJest({
  // Provide the path to your Next.js app to load next.config.js and .env files in your test environment
  dir: './',
})

// Add any custom config to be passed to Jest
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
const customJestConfig = {
  // Add more setup options before each test is run
  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  // if using TypeScript with a baseUrl set to the root directory then you need the below for alias' to work
  moduleDirectories: ['node_modules', '<rootDir>/'],
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
}

// createJestConfig is exported this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js config which is async
module.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)
```
- in the `package.json` file add an entry in the script named "test" to run "jest"
```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "test": "jest",
    "test-watch": "jest --watch"
  },
```
the command `npm run test-watch` will essentially just continue to run the tests as we change them. Run this now and we'll see that there's no tests so we'll go write one!

1. Install the mock server worker and isomorphic-fetch so that we can "mock" out the calls to quotable.io. also install install jest-fixed-dom.
```
npm install msw isomorphic-fetch jest-fixed-jsdom --save-dev
```
1. update the jest.config.js with jest-fixed-jsdom.
```js
// jest.config.js
// ... rest of the config ...
const customJestConfig = {
    // everything stays the same.
    testEnvironment: 'jest-fixed-jsdom', // change this.
}
// ... rest of the config ...
```
2. Create a `Home.test.js` in a newly created folder named `tests` that's at the root of the application, setup the mock service worker `msw` package and import our testing requirements.
- create the file `tests/Home.test.js`
- in the file import the following
```jsx
import { render, screen, act } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'

import 'isomorphic-fetch'                        // needed to fix 'fetch' runtime errors; see explanation above
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw';        // this will mock http requests & responses
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';          // we'll set up a "mocked" server that simulates low-level HTTP interaction

import { BASE_URL } from '../utils/api/base.js'; // we'll need this for our "mocked" HTTP server / REST API
import Home from '../pages/index.js'
```
- then, set up your server so that it begins to listen `beforeAll` of the tests run and closes `afterAll` of the tests are done.
```jsx
// ... imports from Step 2 go here ...

// mock data
const QUOTE = "All I required to be happy was friendship and people I could admire."
const AUTHOR = "Charles Baudelaire"


// server setup
const server = setupServer(

  // here, i'm mocking one possible API endpoint â€” for multiple endpoints, write more of these as arguments!
  http.get(
    `${BASE_URL}/api/random_quote`,
    () => {
      // now we're going to construct a response using a mocked JSON body
      return HttpResponse.json({
        quote: QUOTE,
        author: AUTHOR,
      })
    }
  )

);

// now that we have the server set up, 'run' it before our actual tests get called!
beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen();  // before all tests run, simulate server starting & listening for requests
});

afterAll(() => {
  server.close();  // after all tests are finished, simulate server stopping
});
```
Note:
Here we use `setupServer` with one argument.
If you wanted to handle multiple requests, just keep on adding them as different arguments.

You could also add of the `rest` requests in an array and then spread that array in the `setupServer` as
arguments.

See that `beforeAll` will be called before all the `test`s & `afterAll` will be called after all the `test`s.

3. Let's write a test that will wait for the `useEffect` to render our first load of the `Home` component.
```jsx
// ... imports from Step 2 go here ...

// ... server setup from Step 3 goes here, mocked with QUOTE & AUTHOR ...

// in my actual code, I've used describe + it syntax, but I'll keep it vanilla for the readme.
test("test home loads a quote on load", async () => {
    // wait for the Home component to render.
    await act(() => {
        render(<Home/>)
    })
    // get the author and quote element from the rendered DOM
    let quoteElement = screen.getByTestId("quote")
    let authorElement = screen.getByTestId("author")

    // check to see that they contain the predetermined values.
    expect(quoteElement).toHaveTextContent(QUOTE)
    expect(authorElement).toHaveTextContent(AUTHOR)
})
```
This is using an `await` function because it needs to wait for the `useEffect` to fire on mount.
We also see that our quote data isn't the original values we see in the `Home` component's default state (i.e. different than `DEFAULT_QUOTE`, `DEFAULT_AUTHOR`), and that our values are now equal to the `QUOTE` and `AUTHOR`.

NOTE: the `test` *needs* to be an `async` function that `await`s the `act` or you'll struggle.

4. Let's write a test that checks the quote is changed on the `Home` component after the button is clicked.
```jsx
// ... imports here ...

// the following two lines are shown for emphasis.
const QUOTE = "All I required to be happy was friendship and people I could admire."
const AUTHOR = "Charles Baudelaire"

// ... server setup (above) here, mocked with QUOTE, AUTHOR ...
test("home loads a new quote when clicking the button.", async () => {
    // load the
    await act(() => {
        render(<Home/>)
    })

    // add a very important quote that will change your life like below.
    const NEW_QUOTE = "I can shoot 3s with my eyes closed."
    const NEW_AUTHOR = "Dan Mouris"

    // create a new request with the new quote and author.
    server.use(
        rest.get(`${BASE_URL}/random`, (req, res, ctx) => {
            // respond using a mocked JSON body
            return res(ctx.json(
                {"_id":"someid",
                "content": NEW_QUOTE,
                "author": NEW_AUTHOR,
                }
            ))
        })
    )
    // get the elements
    let quoteElement = screen.getByTestId("quote")
    let authorElement = screen.getByTestId("author")
    let buttonElement = screen.getByTestId("new-quote-button")

    // click the new button and wait for the state to change.
    await act(() => {
        buttonElement.click()
    })

    // ensure that the new values have been updated correctly.
    expect(quoteElement).toHaveTextContent(NEW_QUOTE)
    expect(authorElement).toHaveTextContent(NEW_AUTHOR)
})
```
First we have the `Home` component rendered with the `QUOTE` and `AUTHOR` values.
Second we mock the server to respond with the `NEW_QUOTE` and `NEW_AUTHOR` with the function `server.use` and passing in a `rest` request.
Third we get the elements and "await" the button click.
Fourth we test to make sure that our component has been updated successfully.

## Conclusion

This is how to mock out and test restful APIs in React. You'll need to do this a lot.
For more information about the [MSW package the docs are here](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started)
For mroe info about [isomorphic fetch the docs are here](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch), although we did exactly what it does here.


## Challenge
Write a test that checks to see that the `numberOfQuotes` has been fetched the correct number of times.
- should expect once after load
- should expect twice after one button click
